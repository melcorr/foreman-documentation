= Distributing SSH Keys for Remote Execution

To use SSH keys for authenticating remote execution connections, you must distribute the public SSH key from {SmartProxy} to its attached hosts that you want to manage. Ensure that the SSH service is enabled and running on the hosts. Configure any network or host-based firewalls to enable access to port 22.

Use one of the following methods to distribute the public SSH key from {SmartProxy} to target hosts:

. xref:sect-Managing_Hosts-Distributing_SSH_Keys_for_Remote_Execution_Manually[].
. xref:sect-Managing_Hosts-Using_API_to_Obtain_SSH_Keys_for_Remote_Execution[].
. xref:sect-Managing_Hosts-Configuring_a_Kickstart_Template_to_Distribute_SSH_Keys_during_Provisioning[].

{Project} distributes SSH keys for the remote execution feature to the hosts provisioned from {Project} by default.

If the hosts are running on Amazon Web Services, enable password authentication. For more information, see link:https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/[].
