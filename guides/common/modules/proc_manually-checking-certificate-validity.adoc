= Manually Checking Certificate Validity

During the installation process, any certificates for Katello are checked for validity.
The same can be performed manually with `katello-certs-check`.
Manually checking certificate validity can be useful when looking into SSL-related issues or configuring custom certificates.

.Procedure

To manually check a certificate, enter the following command:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
katello-certs-check -c ~/path/to/server.crt \
                    -k ~/path/to/server.key \
                    -b ~/path/to/cacert.crt
----

If you want to configure Katello with a set of invalid certs,
the validation check can be skipped by passing `--certs-skip-check` to the {foreman-installer}.
